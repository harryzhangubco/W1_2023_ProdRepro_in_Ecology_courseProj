\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In this mini project for course BIOL520I Productivity and
Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution, the \emph{palmerpenguins} data
package was explored in R to understand the bill attributes of sampled
penguin species. Tables and figures were created in this process. No
in-depth analysis was conducted because the overall purpose of this mini
project is to simply demonstrate a reproducible workflow.

\hypertarget{method}{%
\section{Method}\label{method}}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

The dataset used in this project is accessed from R data pacakge
\emph{palmerpenguins} \citep{Horst2020}, originally published in
\citet{Gorman2014}.

\hypertarget{process}{%
\subsection{Process}\label{process}}

The dataset \emph{penguins} was imported to dataframe from the data
package. A copy of the raw, unaltered data was saved as a CSV file. The
dataframe was then examined to understand the data structure
completeness, where observations with missing bill attributes were
dropped for simplicity in this demonstration. After cleaning up the
data, I calculated simple descriptive statistics for bill dimensions
(\emph{bill\_length\_mm} and \emph{bill\_depth\_mm} variables) and
compared them across the three sampled species. Tables and boxplots were
created to show these differences in bill dimensions. An additional
histogram was created to show bill length distribution within the
species \emph{``Adelie''}. Finally, a scatterplot of bill dimensions was
created across all three species with bill length on the x-axis and bill
depth on the y-axis to visualize any potential correlation between the
two variables. The scatter points were colored by species to aid
identification of specific clustering in the variable space.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

The bill lengths by species is summarized in Table \ref{billLen}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lrrrr@{}}
\caption{\label{billLen}Bill Length by Species}\tabularnewline
\toprule()
species & min & mean & median & max \\

\toprule()

\endhead
Adelie & 32.1 & 38.79139 & 38.80 & 46.0 \\
Gentoo & 40.9 & 47.50488 & 47.30 & 59.6 \\
Chinstrap & 40.9 & 48.83382 & 49.55 & 58.0 \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

The bill dimensions scatterplot (Figure \ref{scatter}) shows a visually
detectable positive correlation between \emph{bill\_length\_mm} and
\emph{bill\_depth\_mm} within species. There is specific clustering in
the variable space.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

I have found a qualitatively positive correlation between bill length
and bill depth in all three sampled penguin species. This correlation
can be quantified using regression methods in future studies.

The bill attribute observations show a tendency of clustering by species
in the bill dimension variable space. This suggests differences in bill
sizes and shape characteristics across the three species. Further
research on these characteristics may lead to quantitative methods to
identify sample species using bill dimension measurements. \pagebreak \#
