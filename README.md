# W1_2023_ProdRepro_in_Ecology_courseProj

*Harry Zhang, UBC Okanagan* (20230927)

## Project Summary

This is a course project for BIOL520I_2023 W1 - Productivity/Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution. A GitHub repository and R Project were created to version control the contents. An OSF repository is used to store all relative materials, including a project archive to facilitate complete reproduction of the project workflow.

## Folders and Contents

The project folder contains the following: R project and GitHub project required files, data folders (./Data_1\_Raw, ./Data_2\_Work, ./Data_3\_Out), script folder (./Scripts), and output folders (./Figures, ./Manuscript). Raw data is imported from R package *palmerpenguins*, and no data is imported from file - all data files are duplicate/intermediate for demonstration purposes only. A structured file naming convention is therefore not enforced. The script *"Data_analysis.R"* alone is needed to reproduce the analytic results. It is however strongly recommended to preserve the folder structure as the .R and .Rmd scripts use relative pathnames.
